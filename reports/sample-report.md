# Sample Report for WebEcoAnalyzer

## Overview
This report provides an analysis of the energy efficiency of the website [example.com]. The analysis was conducted using the WebEcoAnalyzer tool, which evaluates static code patterns, collects performance metrics, and generates actionable recommendations to optimize energy consumption.

## Analysis Summary
- **Total Energy Consumption Estimated**: 150 Wh
- **Performance Metrics**:
  - CPU Time: 120 ms
  - Memory Usage: 50 MB
  - Network Requests: 15

## Energy Inefficient Patterns Identified
1. **Excessive Use of Timers**: Multiple JavaScript timers were found running concurrently, leading to increased CPU load.
2. **Large Image Sizes**: Several images were not optimized for web use, contributing to higher data transfer and loading times.
3. **Inefficient Loops**: Certain JavaScript functions contained nested loops that could be optimized for better performance.

## Recommendations
1. **Optimize Images**: Compress images using tools like ImageOptim or TinyPNG to reduce file sizes without sacrificing quality.
2. **Minimize JavaScript Execution**: Refactor JavaScript code to eliminate unnecessary timers and optimize loops for better performance.
3. **Reduce Network Requests**: Combine CSS and JavaScript files where possible to decrease the number of requests made during page load.

## Conclusion
By implementing the recommendations provided in this report, the website can significantly reduce its energy consumption, contributing to a more sustainable web environment. Regular audits using the WebEcoAnalyzer tool are encouraged to maintain energy efficiency standards.
